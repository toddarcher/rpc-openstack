    For all newton releases up to r14.8.0 when executing the os-nova-install.yml
    playbook the ``nova-novncproxy`` and ``nova-spicehtml5proxy`` services will
    fail. The workaround to resolve this issue is to restart the services.

    .. code-block:: shell-session

      cd /opt/rpc-openstack/openstack-ansible/playbooks
      # start the service again
      # replace nova-novncproxy with nova-spicehtml5proxy when appropriate
      ansible nova_console -m service -a 'name=nova-novncproxy state=restarted'
      # set the appropriate facts to prevent the playbook trying
      # to reload it again when the playbook is run again
      ansible nova_console -m ini_file -a 'dest=/etc/ansible/facts.d/openstack_ansible.fact section=nova option=need_service_restart value=False'
